# Overview

This repository contains files for the threat field simulator research conducted at WPI's Autonomous Vehicles Mobility Institue (AVMI). The system is comprised of three main subsystems: the projector system, camera system, and mobile robot. The projector system is visualize a threat field by generating a color image representing the values of a function in 2D space and projecting this field on the floor of the workspace. The camera system consists of four webcams connected to a Raspberry Pi which can be used for perception of the threat field. Finally, a mobile robot is used to sense the field and navigate the workspace, facilitating a platform for conducting real-world experiments. More details about this setup are provided in the documentation.
